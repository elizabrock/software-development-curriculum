# Grocery Price Tracker

## Elevator Pitch

I can never tell if a sale is actually good or if it's just marketing bullshit.  I want to track my grocery costs so I can tell if a sale is good.

## Project Requirements

  * Simple feature set
  * CRUD
  * A nice complex query in there somewhere

## Feature List:

   * I can enter information from my receipt: Product Name, Calories/Unit, Price
   * I can query for my avg/min/max cost/calorie and /unit on a product
   * I can look at the full list of products
   * I can get a report of my most and least expensive products per calorie

## Interesting Query:

Figuring out which foods are most economical per calorie.

## Data Source:

Calorie Data from the USDA (data.gov)

Enter my own receipts for pricing.
