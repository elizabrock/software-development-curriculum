# Data Models

Data Models are a set of concepts to describe a database *structure* (schema) and *operations* on that data.

## Database Schema

Schemas are a description of the data in the database.  This is separate from the actual data.

For example, int(4) might be part of the schema for a column whose data holds year numbers (e.g. 2001, 2004, 2016, etc.)

## Database State

The database state is the actual content (data) of the database at a particular point in time.

## Keys (Primary, Foreign)

Keys are the unique characteristics that allow us to tell different database entities apart.
