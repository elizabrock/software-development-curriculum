Software Development Fundamentals with Ruby and Rails
====

## Teaching Style

This course is taught in a fairly free-form manner.  We have a list of topics and exercises that we will be working through, however I typically cover topics based on when students ask questions that lead us into that material.

## Schedule

The class will consist of 4 units over 12 weeks.

Instructional time from 9AM to 12PM, daily.

Lab time from 1PM to 4PM, daily.

Each day generally starts with standup and then continues with lecture topics with discussion time and breaks.

After a lunch break, students work on individual assignments and research.
