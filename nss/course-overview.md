## Why Ruby?

This is a Rails course, right?


So, why are we doing Ruby first-  
and for so very long?


Fundamentals are damn important.

## Expectations

This is not a high-school class, nor should you behave like it is.  This is not a college course, nor should you behave like it is.

This course is your job.  It is preparation for your career.  You will get out of this class what you put into it.

These are my expectations:

* You will attend class when it is in session
* If you cannot attend class, you will notify John and Eliza as soon as possible
* You will aim to complete all assignments on time
* If you cannot complete an assignment in a timely fashion, you will warn your teaching assistant and your instructor as soon as you realize that
* You will get an appropriate amount of rest and sleep for your body
* You will participate in class discussion and ask questions
* You will not compare yourself to others
