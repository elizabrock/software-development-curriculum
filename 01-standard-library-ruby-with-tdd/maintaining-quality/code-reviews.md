# Code Reviews

## What is a code review?

* systematic examination (often known as peer review) of computer source code
* intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase
* done in various forms such as pair programming, informal walkthroughs, and formal inspections

## Why do code reviews?

Because it improves both the overall quality of software and the developers' skills!

## What to check? (Whiteboard discussion time!)

Read the README, the tests, and the code.  While reading them, check for code smells, test smells, and things that generally just don't make sense.

Focus on:
* Duplication
* Readability
* Formatting Consistency

Read about code smells and test smells in the individual articles on those topics.
