# Test Smells

* Multiple asserts per test
* Junk output during the test run
* Only testing the happy path
* Missing edge cases
* Commented out tests
* Insufficient integration tests (not enough to be sure it works)
* Tests that don't apply to the functionality (e.g. testing that you can call MyClass.new without an error)
