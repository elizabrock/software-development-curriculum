## Interesting Cases:

These are some good months/years to focus on.  Don't give them this list but instead have them think about the edge cases as a group, coming up with specific edge conditions (listed below) and specific input that causes those conditions.  They must do this outloud as a a class.

* 02 1800
* 02 2012
* 02 1803
* 03 2014
* 07 1800

The Base and Edge Cases:

* Easy (03/2015)
* Beginning of range
* End of range
* Outside of range
* 6 lines (12/12)
* 4 lines (02/15
* Leap years
* Leap centuries
* Regular years
* Words for months?
