# Linked Lists

Instructions
-----------

  1. Read about unit testing at the following links:
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development
    * http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/unittests.html
  2. Fork this repository and clone your fork
  3. cd into the linked-list-cohort-blueberry folder on your computer
  4. Run `rake` to run the test suite
  5. Make the test suite pass by implementing the LinkedList and LinkedListItem classes
    * Choose one test at a time to work on
    * Once the tests pass, you should refactor and clean up your code
  6. Push your implementation up to github as you work on it.

Test Run Modes
--------------

To run the tests Koans style:

    rake

To run all of the tests at once:

    rake test_all

More Information
----------------

The tests for the project are in the /tests directory.

The stubbed classes that you are to implement are in the /lib directory.

I have numbered the unit tests to give you a hint at the easiest implementation order.

### General Instructions:

1. _Fork_ my linked list repo.
2. Clone _your_ fork.
3. Push things up as you complete them. (e.g. multiple times per milestone)

Caveats
-------

* Don't use hashes
* Don't use arrays (except in the bonus exercise on initialize)
* Only use core Ruby (i.e. No using `require`)
* No copying (from the internet or your peers)

## Milestone 1: Implement LinkedListItem
> requires: introduction-to-datatypes-and-structures, linked-lists

Implement all of the tests for LinkedListItems.

## Milestone 2: Implement LinkedList

Implement all of the tests for LinkedList.

## Milestone 3: Implement Search/Sorting
> requires: Searching & Sorting

Implement the final searching/sorting tests.  These tests won't be pushed up until we've covered searching and sorting in class.
