## Code Retreat
> Instructor's Note: Write these rules on the board.

On the day of the code retreat, you will pair program in 45 minute cycles with 15 minute retrospectives between them.

### Code Retreat Rules

1. Always be pairing
2. 45m coding, followed by 15m retrospective
3. Delete your code after each session
4. Test-Driven Development only!

### Conway's Game of Life Rules

1. Any live cell with <strong>less than 2</strong> live neighbors <strong>dies</strong> (under-population).
2. Any live cell with <strong>2 or 3</strong> live neighbors <strong>lives on</strong>.
3. Any live cells with <strong>more than 3</strong> live neighbors <strong>dies</strong> (over-population).
4. Any dead cell with <strong>exactly 3</strong> living neighbors becomes <strong>alive</strong> (birth).
