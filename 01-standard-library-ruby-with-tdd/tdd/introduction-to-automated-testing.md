## Notes from Previous Classes

From Pete ??'s reminder about Sandi Metz:

> I talked with a couple people in class this afternoon about testing and how to sort out what to test and how.  Tonight I watched Sandi Metz's talk about testing (I think Eliza first mentioned it) and it was amazing.  It makes the process seem borderline simple and straightforward.  I think the half our of watching the video would be recouped in the next hour of coding.  Here is the link:

(Sandi and Bob are extremely well respected in the field.)
