# Iterators (in Ruby)

This is a quick summary of iterators in Ruby

fun fact: "iter" is latin for journey

## each
each executes an operation for all objects in whatever (e.g., a string, an array) the method is called upon

block usage:

    array = [1, 2, 3]
    array.each |num|
      puts num
    end

returns

    1
    2
    3

in-line usage of `.each_byte`:

    "string".each_byte{|numeric_value_for_character| puts numeric_value_for_character}

returns

    115
    116
    114
    105
    110
    103

in-line usage of `.each_line`:

    "st\nri\nng".each_line{|line| puts line}

returns

    st
    ri
    ng

## while

Executes an operation as long as the conditional returns true

    i = 0
    while i < "string".length
       puts "string"[i]
       i+=1
    end

returns

    s
    t
    r
    i
    n
    g

## retry:
retry starts a statement from the beginning

## yield:
yield could be thought of as standing in for a block of code
that one passes to a function
in other words, if one provides block of code as an argument to a function
that block of code will run where one has typed yield

    def repeat(num)
      while num > 0
        yield
        num -= 1
      end
    end

    repeat(3) {print "foo\n"}

returns

    foo
    foo
    foo  

`{print "foo\n"}` runs each time `yield` is called.


## .map method
map iterates through an array and does an operation on each object

    vegetables = ["carrots", "peas", "potatos"]

    i_like = vegetables.map do |v|
      "delicious " + v
    end

returns

    ["delicious carrots", "delicious peas", "delicious potatos"]  

`.map!` will alter the existing array
so in this instance it would change vegetables

## .times
`.times` will execute an operation a specified number of times

    print "how many licks does it take"
    print " to get to the center of a tootsie pop?"
    array = ["one", "two", "three"]
    3.times do |num|
      puts "#{array[i]}"
    end

returns

    "one"
    "two"
    "three"  

## until
one can use until to specify a condition that will stop the iterator
for instance

    until i = 3 do
      # some code goes here
    end

would stop the iterator when `i` reached three
