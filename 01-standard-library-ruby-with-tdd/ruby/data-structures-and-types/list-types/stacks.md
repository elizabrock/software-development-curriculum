# Stacks

Stacks are a Last-In First-Out (LIFO) data structure.

![Stack example from Rose-Hulman](rose-hulman-stack.png)

Stacks are very efficient for adding and removing items.  However, you can only access items that are at the end of the list (e.g. no random access of elements).

    | Operation     | Efficiency |
    | Push          | O(1)       |
    | Pop           | O(1)       |
    | Random Access | --         |

## Real World Examples:

* Plates on a buffet plate dispenser
* Pancakes

## Uses in Software:

* Tracking progress through a maze
* Providing “unlimited undo” in an application
