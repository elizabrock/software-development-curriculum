# Cheers

How do we start a new program?

Let’s try it by building:

A <strong>small</strong> program
that takes <strong>input</strong>
and <strong>does something</strong> with it.

## Cheers, Pt. 1: In-class Exploration

This is an in-class exercise that we will do together.

Let's explore strings, gets, puts, and ARGV by building a small program that takes asks the user for their name and then prints it back out again.

We will name our program cheers.rb, and run it in the command-line:

  > ruby cheers.rb

## Cheers, Pt. 2: Cheering Names
> requires: introduction-to-ruby, loop-control-structures, conditional-control-structures

Build on the results of our in-class exploration to output, for example:

    Give me an... A
    Give me a... B
    Give me a... B
    Give me a... Y
    ABBY’s just GRAND!

When given the input of “Abby”.

Note: the “a” vs. “an”

## Cheers, Pt. 3: Cheering Birthdays
> requires: reading-rdoc-documentation

Add on to part 1!  Follow up on the cheer above by asking:

    Hey, Abby, what’s your birthday?

And, replying based on the output with a notification of how many days away their birthday is:

    Awesome!  Your birthday is in 45 days! Happy Birthday in advance!

<u>You’re going to have to use the Ruby Docs for the Date class.</u>
