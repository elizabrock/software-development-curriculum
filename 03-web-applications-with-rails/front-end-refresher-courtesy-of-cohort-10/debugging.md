# Debugging Techniques
DevTools, are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into the browser. The DevTools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application. Use the DevTools to efficiently track down layout issues, set JavaScript breakpoints, and get insights for code optimization.
## Accessing the DevTools
To access the DevTools, open a web page or web app in Google Chrome.
* Select the Chrome menu Chrome Menu at the top-right of your browser window, then select More Tools > Developer Tools.
* The DevTools window will open at the bottom of your Chrome browser.

There are several useful shortcuts for opening the DevTools:
* Use Ctrl+Shift+I for windows (or Cmd+Opt+I on Mac) to open the DevTools.
* Use Ctrl+Shift+J for windows (or Cmd+Opt+J on Mac) to open the DevTools and bring focus to the Console.
* Use Ctrl+Shift+C for windows (or Cmd+Shift+C on Mac) to open the DevTools in Inspect Element mode, or toggle Inspect Element mode if the DevTools are already open.


##Working with the Console
The JavaScript Console provides two primary functions for developers testing web pages and applications. It is a place to:
  * Log diagnostic information in the development process. A shell prompt which can be used to interact with the document and DevTools. You may log diagnostic information using methods provided by the Console API. Such as console.log().
  * You can evaluate expressions directly in the console and use the methods provided by the Command Line API. These include $() command for selecting elements.
