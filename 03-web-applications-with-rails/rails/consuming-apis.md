# Consuming APIs in Rails

## Before Continuing

Make sure you are familiar with RESTful Web services before using the following gems.

  - [REST API Tutorial](http://www.restapitutorial.com/)

## Overview

Prior to Rails 4.0 consuming APIs could have been accomplished with a component included in Rails called ActiveResource. Since Rails 4.0 that functionality has been extracted to the gem `activeresource`. However, gems like `httparty` and `faraday` have become the choice for many developers and are widely implemented. This guide serves as an intro to these three gems.

But wait a minute...

Many popular web services (Twitter, Flickr, Linkedin, etc) have gems created specifically for that service. It is recommended to use such specific gems first if one is available. Here is a list of API client gems already available:

## activeresouce

[activeresource on Github](https://github.com/rails/activeresource)

Model classes are mapped to remote REST resources by Active Resource much the same way Active Record maps model classes to database tables. When a request is made to a remote resource, a REST JSON request is generated, transmitted, and the result received and serialized into a usable Ruby object.

### Download and installation

The latest version of Active Resource can be installed with RubyGems:

  `sudo gem install activeresource`

Or added to a Gemfile:

  `gem 'activeresource'`

### Configuration and Usage

Putting Active Resource to use is very similar to Active Record.  It's as simple as creating a model class
that inherits from ActiveResource::Base and providing a <tt>site</tt> class variable to it:

  `class Person < ActiveResource::Base
      self.site = "http://api.people.com:3000"
  end`

Now the Person class is REST enabled and can invoke REST services very similarly to how Active Record invokes
life cycle methods that operate against a persistent store.

   Find a person with id = 1
   tyler = Person.find(1)
   Person.exists?(1)  # => true

As you can see, the methods are quite similar to Active Record's methods for dealing with database
records.  But rather than dealing directly with a database record, you're dealing with HTTP resources (which may or may not be database records).


## httparty

[httparty on Github](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty)

HTTParty is a Ruby library by John Nunemaker (of railstips.org fame) which allows developers to build classes that can use Web-based APIs and related services. At its simplest, you include the HTTParty module within a class, which gives your class a "get" method that can retrieve data over HTTP. Further directives, however, instruct HTTParty to parse results (XML, JSON, and so on), define base URIs for the requests, and define HTTP authentication information.

### Install

`gem install httparty`

### Examples

```ruby
# Use the class methods to get down to business quickly
response = HTTParty.get('https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/questions?site=stackoverflow')

puts response.body, response.code, response.message, response.headers.inspect

# Or wrap things up in your own class
class StackExchange
  include HTTParty
  base_uri 'api.stackexchange.com'

  def initialize(service, page)
    @options = { query: {site: service, page: page} }
  end

  def questions
    self.class.get("/2.2/questions", @options)
  end

  def users
    self.class.get("/2.2/users", @options)
  end
end

stack_exchange = StackExchange.new("stackoverflow", 1)
puts stack_exchange.questions
puts stack_exchange.users
```

## faraday

[faraday on Github](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday)

Faraday is an HTTP client lib that provides a common interface over many adapters (such as Net::HTTP) and embraces the concept of Rack middleware when processing the request/response cycle.

### Usage

```ruby
conn = Faraday.new(:url => 'http://sushi.com') do |faraday|
  faraday.request  :url_encoded             # form-encode POST params
  faraday.response :logger                  # log requests to STDOUT
  faraday.adapter  Faraday.default_adapter  # make requests with Net::HTTP
end

## GET ##

response = conn.get '/nigiri/sake.json'     # GET http://sushi.com/nigiri/sake.json
response.body

conn.get '/nigiri', { :name => 'Maguro' }   # GET http://sushi.com/nigiri?name=Maguro

conn.get do |req|                           # GET http://sushi.com/search?page=2&limit=100
  req.url '/search', :page => 2
  req.params['limit'] = 100
end

## POST ##

conn.post '/nigiri', { :name => 'Maguro' }  # POST "name=maguro" to http://sushi.com/nigiri

# post payload as JSON instead of "www-form-urlencoded" encoding:
conn.post do |req|
  req.url '/nigiri'
  req.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
  req.body = '{ "name": "Unagi" }'
end

## Per-request options ##

conn.get do |req|
  req.url '/search'
  req.options.timeout = 5           # open/read timeout in seconds
  req.options.open_timeout = 2      # connection open timeout in seconds
end
```

If you don't need to set up anything, you can roll with just the bare minimum:

```ruby
# using the default stack:
response = Faraday.get 'http://sushi.com/nigiri/sake.json'
```
