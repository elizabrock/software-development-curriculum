# Diagramming software

Diagrams are extremely helpful in communicating about software.

This is a quick outline of the go-to options in your diagramming toolbox.

## ERD: Entity Relationship Diagrams

Entity Relationship diagrams are used to illustrate how data is stored in a system, and how the various pieces of data are related.

See:
* the Entity Relationship Diagrams article.

## UML Class Diagrams

Class diagrams are used for showing the classes in a system, along with their attributes and methods.
