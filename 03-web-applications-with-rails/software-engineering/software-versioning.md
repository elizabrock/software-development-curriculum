# Software Versioning

> Software versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software

## Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning is a method of versioning software in which each number in the version number has a specific meaning.

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

  1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
