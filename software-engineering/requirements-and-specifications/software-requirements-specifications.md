# Software Requirements Specifications

> A Software requirements specification (SRS), a requirements specification for a software system, is a description of the behavior of a system to be developed and may include a set of use cases that describe interactions the users will have with the software. In addition it also contains non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements impose constraints on the design or implementation (such as performance engineering requirements, quality standards, or design constraints). -- Wikipedia

In your career as a software developer, you will run into (and perhaps be asked to write) formal software requirements and specifications.  You should at least be familiar with the format and terminology of these documents (see references below for details).
