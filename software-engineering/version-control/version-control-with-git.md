# Version Control with Git

## Why version control?

  * Backup
  * Rollback
  * History
  * Deployment
  * No Emailing Files
  * No more index.final.v6.html, etc.

## GIT

  * Distributed
  * Fast
  * Complicated

## Basic GIT commands

You should know how to:

  * Create a local repository
  * Add files to the repository
  * Commit those files (-m)
  * Check the repository status
  * Commit more files
  * Looking at all of your commits (and --pretty=oneline)
  * Interactive add changes

## .gitignore

Gitignore tells git about files that you never, ever want to commit.  Examples of these files are things like .DS_Store, editor-specific files and files that contain sensitive information or logs.

### Global .gitignore

Global .gitignore files are great for ignoring operating system specific files (such as .DS_Store) that you will never want to accidentally commit.
