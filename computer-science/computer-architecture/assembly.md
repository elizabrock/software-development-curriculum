# Basics of Assembly

> An assembly language is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (generally one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, in contrast to most high-level programming languages, which are generally portable across multiple architectures, but require interpreting or compiling.

## In Class Examples:

(Take the accuracy of these with a grain of salt, since I [Eliza] haven't actually done assembly since 2007.)
