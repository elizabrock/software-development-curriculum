## Teaching Style

This course is taught in a fairly free-form manner.  We have a list of topics and exercises that we will be working through, however I typically cover topics based on when students ask questions that lead us into that material.

## Schedule

The class will consist of 4 units over 12 weeks.

Typically the schedule is:

* Instructional time from 9AM to 12PM, daily.
* Lab time from 1PM to 4PM, daily.

Each day generally starts with standup and then continues with lecture topics with discussion time and breaks.

After a lunch break, students work on individual assignments and research.
