Often, I'll have a short diagnostic quiz at the beginning of the course to gauge how much they learned in the prior course.

The list of possible questions is below.  This list is a little CSS/HTML heavy because I couldn't find the version of the quiz that focuses on javascript knowledge.


* What is a database?
* What is a prototype (in Javascript)?
* What is an API?
* Given this button, `<input type="submit" id="whosit" class="button" />`, what CSS would you use to turn the "shop now" button text blue when your cursor is over the button?
* What is the difference between margins and padding?
* What does CSS stand for and how does that apply to how you should organize your css file?
* Why do you use different html tags instead of writing your html entirely with div tags?
* What is the difference between block, inline and inline-block elements?
* How do you position an element in front of another element(like an in-window pop up)?
