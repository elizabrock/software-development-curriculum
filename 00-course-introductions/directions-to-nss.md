# NSS Location & WiFi

Nashville Software School is located at 283 Plus Park Blvd, Nashville, 37217.  This is near the junctions of I-440, I-24 and I-40 just east of downtown on the way to the airport.  

From downtown Nashville, take I-40 East towards the airport.  Stay in the far right hand lane and take I-24 when you get to the split of I-40 and I-24.  Stay to the right and take the Murfreesboro Road exit off I-24.  Once you are on Murfreesboro Road, go through the first stop light (Spence Lane).  The second stop light is Plus Park Blvd.  - turn right on Plus Park Blvd. then see the rest of the direction to our building two paragraphs below.

If you come from the south side of Nashville or from Williamson County you'll come north on I-65, take I-440 east all the way to I-24. Take the ramp from I-440 to I-24 as if you were going to the airport. There is an exit to Murfreesboro Road off the ramp from 440 to 24 - take that ramp to Murfreesboro Road.  At the bottom of the ramp turn right on Murfreesboro Road heading away from downtown.  Stay in the far right-hand lane and take a right at the first stop light - that is Plus Park Blvd.  

Take Plus Park Blvd up the hill and then back down the hill.  283 Plus Park Blvd will be on the right hand side of Plus Park Blvd about 2/3 of a mile from Murfreesboro Pike.  It is the last commercial building on Plus Park Blvd. before the road goes into an apartment complex.  The driveway entrance to our building has a small sign at ground level with the name of a Spanish-language church that is in the building next to us so if you see the sign for Primera Iglesia Bautista that's the driveway where you turn right.  

283 Plus Park Blvd is a plain grey one story commercial/industrial building (the first of two long buildings that are side by side) with glass all along the wall.  If you face the building from the parking lot, our entry door is at the far right hand end of the building. (We are the building with a green roof, not the building with the red roof and awning).
