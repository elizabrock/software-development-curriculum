# Presentation Instructions

Each presentation should take approximately 5 minutes and cover the following material:

1. Goals (30 seconds)
  * Pull these from your elevator summary, user stories and/or README
2. Demo (2 minutes)
  * You don't have to demonstrate all of the functionality, just the high points.
  * In particular, demonstrating the ability to sign in/sign up is a poor use of time unless there is something special about you sign in/up process.
3. Lessons Learned (1 minute)
  * This can be cathartic!
4. Question and Answer time (up to 5 minutes)
  * There will be questions, I promise.  Ask for questions and then pause while people gather their thoughts.

## Important points to remember:

* You should use the slide deck in this folder (or a similar one of your own creation) to assist in your presentation.  Filling in the presentation template I have provided ([presentation-template.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elizabrock/software-development-curriculum/master/nss/presentation-template.html), in this directory) should take you no more than 5 minutes.
* If you have a slide deck through an online service, ensure that you have a local copy of it just in case.
* Make sure that you have an appropriate dongle for your laptop (or that one will be available to you the day of the presentations).
* Speak loudly and clearly, facing your audience.
* DO NOT emphasize broken parts of the program.  If you notice a bug while you're presenting, just gloss past it. This is an important skill to learn for giving product demos.
* DO NOT insult your own work.  People tend to take a person's self-evaluation at face value and you'll simply be setting people up to think your work is sub-par.
* Avoid referencing other student's presentations in a "well, they covered everything I had to say on my lessons learned".  Your presentation should stand alone.
* Your presentation and application should be complete the evening before presentations. You are expected to have your laptop closed and your attention on the presenter during the presentations.
