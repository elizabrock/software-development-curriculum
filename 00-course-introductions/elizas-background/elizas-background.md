# Eliza's Background

## Who Am I?

I'm Eliza (Brock) Marcum, Software Engineer.

I went to highschool in Nashville, at Hume-Fogg.

And then, attended Rose-Hulman, a small yet well-regarded engineering school in Terre-Haute, IN.

I graduated with a double major in Software Engineering and Computer Science, and went to work for a bio-tech firm.

After 5 delightless winters in Indiana, I was terribly homesick for Nashville.  I spent a lot of time fantasizing about returning to Centennial Park.

So, I moved back to Nashville, and worked first at a local mobile development consultancy and then a boutique eCommerce startup (think Etsy-for-$5000-dresses).

I then started Eliza Brock Software, a software consultancy with a focus on web application development. And, a few years later, started teaching at Nashville Software School.

After NSS switched to running 2 cohorts at a time, I had to choose between scaling up my business and doubling down on teaching.

I chose teaching, and here we are!
