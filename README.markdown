Software Development (with Rails) Curriculum
===============================

The goal of this repository is to aggregate all of the course materials I've developed in the first four Nashville Software School cohorts.

## The Plan:

This is the unified repository of all information we have/do cover in the software development fundamentals course at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com).  It is used by the [courseware](http://coursewareofthefuture.herokuapp.com) to populate the course materials.

## The Course Timeline:

Reference courses from the courseware are linked below.  Not all of them used the courseware, or used the courseware for the whole course.

* https://coursewareofthefuture.herokuapp.com/courses/1/calendar
* https://coursewareofthefuture.herokuapp.com/courses/3/calendar
* https://coursewareofthefuture.herokuapp.com/courses/6/calendar
* https://coursewareofthefuture.herokuapp.com/courses/7/calendar

The general timeline:

### Unit 0:

* Week 1, day 1: They wrap up their capstones from the last Class
* Week 1, day 2: The present their capstones in the AM.  You'll have a little time for class intro material in the PM

### Unit 1:

* Week 1, day 3-4: Cheers
* Week 1d4 through Week 2: Koans
* Week 3: Linked Lists
* Week 4: cal

### Unit 2:

* Week 5: SQL; Start Databases/Ruby Capstone
* Week 6: Databases/Ruby Capstone; Refactor into ActiveRecord

### Unit 3:

* Week 7: Sometimes a Rails Front-End/Views project
* Week 8-9: In-class Rails Project

Week 10 is not scheduled here, but one or more of the projects will take a few extra days, so don't worry about it.

### Unit 4:

* Weeks 11-12: Guest lecturers and "Advanced" topics in AM; Capstone work in PM

The students present their final projects after the break.

## Contributions:

Contributions are quite welcome!

We have a ton of articles that you can contribute to documented in the Github issues for this repo.

## Notes:

Files with the ".markdown" extension are purposely ignored by the courseware, so that we can use that extension for non-curriculum notes and markdown files.
