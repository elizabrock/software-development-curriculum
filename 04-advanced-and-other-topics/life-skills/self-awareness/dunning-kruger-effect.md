# The Dunning-Kruger Effect

> The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias manifesting in two principal ways:
>
> * Unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly rating their ability much higher than is accurate. This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude.
> * Those persons to whom a skill or set of skills come easily may find themselves with weak self-confidence, as they may falsely assume that others have an equivalent understanding. See [also, ] Impostor syndrome.
