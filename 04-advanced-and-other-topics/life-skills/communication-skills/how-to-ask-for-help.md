# How To Ask For Help

## Anonymous student's advice on asking for help:

> Here's a great article by Patty Azzarello (great thought leader on leadership and career, who hasn't sacrificed her soul, and gives practical, non-BS advice) on how asking for help is critical to success in work and life, http://www.tlnt.com/2012/11/28/asking-for-help-or-how-i-reached-out-and-became-an-accidental-expert/

> "The most successful people get the most help.
>
> They are not so successful because they are so great and smart on their own. Itâ€™s because they get the most help."
>
> I think it would come across wrong if I sent this out to the cohort, but if you think it's useful to send it out (without mentioning me) feel free to.


## How to Express Problems:

## Scenario 1

### Bad:

* It blew up
* It exploded
* It's not working for no reason

### Good:

Explain:

1. What it should do
2. What it did do
3. What you've already tried
4. Summarize error messages

## Scenario 2

### Bad:

* I'm sorry, but...
* This is a stupid question, but...

### Good:

Just ask the damn question.
