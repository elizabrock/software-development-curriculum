# Social Engineering (Security)

## Overview

Social Engineering, from a security perspective, refers to the psychological manipulation of a person in order to get private or confidential information (often passwords or other private account information).
It is interesting to note that some of the most successful scammers have commented that it is often much easier to get a person to reveal their personal and confidential information than it is to "hack" a user's account.
Thus, social engineering scams are often considered "human hacks".

## Most Common Scams

### Pretexting
Pretexting often involves an elaborate lie in order to engage a victim with the hacker.  Examples include a hacker impersonating someone with authority or in a position with a "right to know".
Some research is often required in order to perpetuate the lie.  An obtained social security number, or birth date, is often used to gain the trust of the victim before prying for personal and confidential information.

### Phishing

Phishing is one of the most common forms of social engineering.  Phishing involves baiting a victim, and then leading them to disclose information.
A common example is that of the wealthy Nigerian individual looking for an American bank account to transfer funds to.
An individual is encouraged to either send money, or reveal a bank account for transfer of funds.

Another common phishing scheme involves sending an individual to a phony website (disguised to look exactly like that of a legitimate bank or business).
An email would direct a victim to a website asking for their login credentials.  The site would look exactly like that of the actual business, but the
login credentials would then be stolen from the victim.

### Baiting

Baiting involves the use of physical media (USB thumb drive, floppy disc, etc.).
An attacker loads the physical media with malware, and then labels the device in such a way as to make it look legitimate.
For example, a USB thumb drive sporting the eBay logo, left somewhere at the eBay office.  The goal is to get a victim
to pick up the device and insert it into a machine on the network the hacker would like to access.

Recently, there have been reports that baiting has been used by the NSA.

### Tailgating

Tailgating involves following a credentialed person into a secure area.  The credentialed individual will often swipe their
security access card, and then the hacker will simply follow them into the building.  Few people will actually stop someone and ask
for their identification.
