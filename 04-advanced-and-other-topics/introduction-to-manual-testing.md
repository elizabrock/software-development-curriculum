# Introduction to Manual Testing

## Acceptance Testing

## Manual Q.A. Testing

(Disciplined)

## Smoke (Undisciplined Manual QA) Testing

The layers of smoke testing:

* Can the interpreter/compiler run/compile it?
* Look for errors (Firebug, logs, etc.)[ I call this Exception Driven Development]
* Look at the output (webpage, perhaps in multiple browsers)
* Check around/smoke testing
* Start testing forms/interactions

* try to find file where problem is
* check exceptions for file name & line number


find problem -> attempt fix -> test more -> (rinse, repeat)
