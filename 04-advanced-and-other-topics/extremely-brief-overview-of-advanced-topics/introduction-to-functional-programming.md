# Introduction to Functional Programming

Functional Programming is a style of programming in which, among other things, all methods are idempotent.  It cultivates a valuable way of thinking that will help you excel in other programming methodologies.

From Wikipedia:

> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. Functional programming emphasizes functions that produce results that depend only on their inputs and not on the program stateâ€”i.e. pure mathematical functions.
